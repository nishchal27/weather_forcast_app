# React Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

The project structure is based on this [starter project](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) from Microsoft.

It uses [Open Weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api) so, it needs a valid api key to be provided in a `.env` file at the root folder with the following format:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
